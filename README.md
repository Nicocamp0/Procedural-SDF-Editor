# Procedural SDF Editor – C++ / OpenGL / libigl

Procedural 3D geometry editor based on Signed Distance Functions (SDF) and Marching Cubes.

The project supports:

* Procedural primitive generation
* Recursive boolean operations
* Real-time mesh reconstruction
* Interactive transformations with ImGui and ImGuizmo
* Recursive color interpolation based on SDF distances

Developed as part of a Numerical Geometry project at the University of Strasbourg.
